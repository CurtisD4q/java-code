/*
Line 9 is the main focus of our program so dont worry too much about the other lines of code above.

The word System is a package which is automatically imported for use in java files. 
By typing in System you can access the methods within it
The word out is the standard output stream(like a tool) for printing out lines of text in a computer program
The word print is the standard method (or function) used for printing objects (basically text and numbers)

In conclusion You need to type in 'System.out.print("Your text here");' to print a line of text
To print a line of text with a new line (backspace) after it you can type in:
'System.out.println("Your text here");'
or "System.out.print("Your text here\n");"

The '\n' automatically creates a new line for you and can be used when you cant use 'println', for whatever reason
